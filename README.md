# Modeling-Wind-Energy-Resources
Map wind energy resource potential across the US.

This project utilizes the NREL Wind Toolkit dataset based on 7 years of modeled data for imaginary turbines at points across the US deemed suitable by NREL. This analysis also uses elevation data from the U.S. Department of the Interior USGS, National Atlas (2007). The main purpose of this project is to perform a multiple linear regression using windspeed at 100m, windspeed cubed, elevation, and slope as independent explanatory variables for capacity factor (CF) which is the average power generated by a turbine divided by the rated capacity. The coefficients from the regression were used to weight variables accordingly and then perform an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to extrapolate CF values to a raster map clipped to the Contiguous United States (CONUS).
